# Lab 8 - Starter

1) I would put the test in github actions and runs whenever code is pushed because it would test my code as I push to github and building it. It will automatically help me test the code and with fixed test, it will prevent me from miss catch some bugs earlier.
2) No, I would not use an E2E test to check if a function is returning the correct output because E2E test are used to emulate real users to the system interactions, and unit test should test smaller functions.
3) No, E2E test should be used on messaging since it has to do with the feature of the application. A unit test is not able to test the message from the app, such as sent and received. 
4) Yes, it would be useful to use a unit for testing the "max message length" because it is tested on a specific function, and this is a purpose of the unit test.
